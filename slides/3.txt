"Some nice testing technology"

* tests in a loop are easy to write... but hard to maintain
  - maintaining testcounts takes heroics
  - understanding failure modes becomes difficult
  - chances are that each iteration of your loop isn't really a unique test

example: slides/3.t

* mock objects
  - lib/WebUtils.pm ; slides/3a.t
