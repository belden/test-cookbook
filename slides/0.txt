Hi, I'm Belden Lyman.

I've put that there in case you have an internet connection and want to run some of the code samples as we talk

Perl for 12 years; full-time Perl developer for 10 years.
* Mar 2000 to Feb 2005 tools guy at a library software company
* Feb 2005 to Nov 2011 with the XP Perl team at AirWave.com - TDD
* Nov 2011 to present with Shutterstock.com - maybe I'm a TDD evangelist here, I don't really know

I'm online and you can read my tweets about werewolves and Perl (that's an exclusive and, I
don't think I've tweeted about werewolves and perl in the same 140 characters).

Also, I'm super nervous and I have no idea why I signed up to do this talk. But look, if I can be accepted
to YAPC to ramble a bit, then any of you can be too. Seriously.
