"Let's go for a spin"

A testdrive is pretty fun, right? You get to try out a new car, and ask yourself all sorts of questions:
* how does this compare to other cars I've driven
* do I like the dashboard and cockpit
* would I want to own this
* maybe you pop the hood to see if you'd be able to tune up the car (nowadays probably not)
* you might collect info about the car: how quickly it accelerates; what type of mileage does it get;
  crash test ratings.

So now you can say hey, I want my tests to help me answer those questions too.
